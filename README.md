## Running the server

First, you have to make sure you are working with virtual environment

Each time you open a terminal, you run:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

The `FLASK_ENV=development` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.


To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run
```
